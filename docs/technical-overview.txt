Introduction
------------
Muteswan is an experimental pseudo anonymous instant message system. It is pseudo
anonymous in the sense that anonymity is enforced (with Tor) while message
access is dependent upon face to face human trust relationships. The intention
is to provide a simple messaging service that is reasonably protected from
surveillance with encryption, yet also protects message sender and receiver
identity. Muteswan adopts the notion of a "circle": a collection of individuals
that share a single symmetric key. Users share their keys with other
individuals face to face, in person using QR codes (2 dimensional bar codes).
An Muteswan client in possession of a symmetric key can send and receive
messages to other people who possess the same key.

The goal is that this framework is flexible enough to be used on the one hand
as a private, secure communication platform and on the other hand as an
information dissemination tool. For example, two individuals sharing a circle
with no else enables private and trusted communication. In other cases,
identity protection is paramount but access to the circle may be more
widespread.

Muteswan uses Tor to anonymize messages sent to the server. Most Muteswan
servers are hosted using Tor hidden nodes. A hidden service on the Tor network
is accessible only to other Tor clients and the server does not know the
identity of the request nor does the client know the identity of the hidden
service serving the response. A very simple RESTful protocol is used to post,
get and discover new messages. Messages are encrypted using AES and accessible
by URL using a SHA1 hash of the AES key.


Intentions, Assumptions and Goals
---------------------------------

This document is intended to be a technical and design reference. The
background assumptions, project goals and potential uses of Muteswan are
outside the scope of this document. However, it is difficult to continue
without some overall frame to help contextualize the impetus and goals of the
project.

Muteswan rests on a few operating assumptions and requirements:
	- Trust and identity do not need to be closely related. Circles of people
who share a community of trust can manage that trust in person, face to face.
Muteswan should facilitate this where it is possible.

	- Identity must always be protected. People need plausible deniability
	  both as authors and readers.

	- Simple and secure: protocol must be designed such that success of
any operation requires maximum anonymity. It should be impossible to use Muteswan
in such a way that leaks your identity. The server should be as small and
stateless as possible, without any logging features.

	- The user should always have control of her identity and risk.

The goal of the Muteswan project is to create an experimental communication
tool that is embedded in the social and geographic space of its users. The
dissemination of information and trust networks, though anonymous, may perhaps
map more closely to real world social relations and thus provide some level of
trust. This (perhaps limited) level of trust is augmented with the protection
of message senders/receivers. Together these two properties - limited but
existent trust and very little individual risk - are desirable.


Protocol Overview
-----------------

Muteswan is extremely simple.  "Circles", or collective use of shared symmetric AES
keys plus a server name, provide centralized access to message data. Possessing
an appropriate AES key along with the name of the Tor hidden server enables
access to the messages on a given circle.

A client/server protocol was built on top of HTTP using RESTful principles.
Clients can:
	- get a single message, 

	- discover the latest message,

	- or post a message.

The Muteswan server itself merely acts as a distribution point. It sends clients
messages and saves messages that are posted to circles but it does not process
or analyze any messages.

Components
~~~~~~~~~~

The individual technical components described below. In some cases, more detail
will be provided in later sections, but this section outlines the core
operative components.

Circles
^^^^^^^


Circles are the only organizational unit in Muteswan. They are composed of three
elements:

	key: a 24-bit AES key,e.g, dba4fe6ef22b494d
	server: a tor hidden service address, e.g., tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion
	shortname: name of the circle, without spaces, e.g., testsite


Circles are usually represented in text form with a '+' separating the name from the key and an '@' separating the key from the server:

testsite+dba4fe6ef22b494d@tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion



Since Muteswan uses symmetric keys, accessing a circle simply involves knowing the
key and the server. Consequently, the text representation of a circle should
never be displayed and the key should be treated as any cryptographic secret.
Muteswan circles are intended to be shared in person, typically via QR code.
The circles should be trivial to communicate via QR code but there should be
no reason to transfer them. It should be mentioned that perhaps one would
desire to distribute QR codes openly if the intention was to attract a large
amount of users to a circle.




Tor client
^^^^^^^^^^

Tor acts as a SOCKS proxy on the client node. Tor runs on many platforms,
including mobile ones. All Muteswan clients need a running local Tor proxy in
order to function.


Muteswan server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Muteswan server is a simple HTTP server using RESTful principles. The server
is essentially stateless: only POST and GET methods are implemented with the
index fetch being the only operation that is not strictly uploading or
downloading an actual file.

Since the server role is so narrow, it can implemented very minimally and
reduce security risks. Also, it should be noted that a compromise of an
Muteswan server could reveal other circles hosted on the hidden service but
would not expose any identities.

NOTE: Muteswan was intended to run as server behind a Tor hidden node, but it
does not need to. A Tor hidden node allows anonymous hosting and reduces the
risk of the Tor server.

Muteswan client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Muteswan client queries the Muteswan server address to fetch message
indexes, individual messages and to post messages. It provides the only
interface to the user. 

It is also the only place where Muteswan keys are stored.  The client is
responsible for managing its own cryptographic stores. At a minimum, this
requires storing key and server information locally.

QR codes
^^^^^^^^

QR codes are used to transmit circle information to other users. Qrcodes were
chosen because they provide a very flexible, convenient and most importantly
they are "embedded in the physical world."

To transmit a circle to another user, a QR code needs to be generated using the
full text description of a circle (shortname+key@server). The individual
receiving the key scans the QR code and imports the circle information into their
client.


Message Encryption
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Muteswan uses standard AES CBC symmetric key cryptography. Every message is
encrypted with the circle key before it is sent. It is posted to the server based
on a SHA1 hash of the circle key. The AES cryptography provides protection from
anyone who has access to the actual tor hidden service as well as a certain
level of protection if an Muteswan server is compromised.

AES is currently used because it is secure and widely supported. The actual
cryptographic algorithm is not material and perhaps changing out or selecting
algorithms is a desirable feature.

Initial vector data is included in the message payload with the JSON key 'iv'.


HTTP/REST
~~~~~~~~~

Muteswan uses a simple RESTful scheme on top of HTTP. Only GET and POST methods are
used and their URLs are well defined.  

JSON is used to encode the message formats. All messages must have a key name
of "message" which contains the base64 encoded encrypted data. For example:
--------------------------------------
{"message":"4u+MgPdfgo9tAdsEX6ceng==","iv":"znMqQ18wEUNWPuAHrPv9PQ=="}
--------------------------------------

URL Scheme
^^^^^^^^^^
|=======
|Action | URL | Example | Output 
|POST msg|http://host/sha1hash| http://tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion/f573fe7d4a34186b00bcab2b38e52122afe04d83  | none, 200 response 
|GET msg|http://host/sha1hash/msgnum| http://tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion/f573fe7d4a34186b00bcab2b38e52122afe04d83/53  | BASE64 encoded msg 
|GET msg range|http://host/sha1hash/msghigh-msglow| http://tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion/f573fe7d4a34186b00bcab2b38e52122afe04d83/53-50  | BASE64 encoded msgs in JSON array 
|GET last message|http://host/sha1hash| http://tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion/f573fe7d4a34186b00bcab2b38e52122afe04d83/53-50  | JSON key 'lastMessage' holds message id latest message 
|=======

POST msg
^^^^^^^^

To post a message to a circle, an Muteswan client uses the POST method with the SHA1
hash of the circle in the request URI. No other argument is allowed on the URI.


An example POST request:
-------------------------------------------------------
POST /3db7814a7d0e23f66906fbfd087bbd8f523f7180 HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 34
Host: tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion
Connection: Keep-Alive

{"message":"4u+MgPdfgo9tAdsEX6ceng==","iv":"znMqQ18wEUNWPuAHrPv9PQ=="}
-------------------------------------------------------


If the container (usually a file system directory) does not exist (that is, no
messages exist yet), than the container is created and the first message is
given an id of 1.

The encrypted message content is BASE64 encoded AES encrypted data. The initial
vector data used is stored in the JSON key "iv".
 
GET msg
^^^^^^^

Fetching a message is as simple as requesting the message id in the URI. For example, the request to fetch message 53 from the 'testsite' circle would be:
---------------------------------------------------------
GET /f573fe7d4a34186b00bcab2b38e52122afe04d83/53 HTTP/1.1
Host: tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion
Connection: Keep-Alive

{"message":"4u+MgPdfgo9tAdsEX6ceng==","iv":"znMqQ18wEUNWPuAHrPv9PQ=="}
---------------------------------------------------------

GET msg range
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fetching a message range is also possible and reduces latency.  For example,
the request t o fetch message 56 to 53 from the 'testsite' circle would be:
---------------------------------------------------------
GET /b975d0e342802b65b3703ff9cf3a378533d980b9/3-2 HTTP/1.1
Host: tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion
Connection: Keep-Alive

[{"timestamp":"Sun, 05 Feb 2012 19:47:17 GMT","content":{"iv":"1IKItlFJCaR+681OQbvSHg==","message":"qmsspIzFxmi1yfslzbG80A=="}},
{"timestamp":"Sun, 05 Feb 2012 19:46:55 GMT","content":{"iv":"VL6RsetTnL+bF3740Fua6Q==","message":"E2/INXzPyRY2nBfFxFAPhg=="}}]
---------------------------------------------------------



GET msg index
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A list of all available messages can be accessed by issuing a GET request on the SHA1 hash alone:
------------------------------------------------------
GET /f573fe7d4a34186b00bcab2b38e52122afe04d83 HTTP/1.1
Host: tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion
Connection: Keep-Alive

{"lastMessage":"8"}
------------------------------------------------------


The message index is sent to the client in the body of HTTP response with the
JSON key 'lastMessage'. Since all messages are sequential and immutable, it
implies that message 1 through Last-Message are available.


Implementations
---------------

There already exist a few implemented components. They are mostly reference
implementations to proof-of-concept the project. Please keep in mind that all
of the implementations below assumes a Tor SOCKS proxy server is running on
localhost at port 9050.

Perl Muteswan server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A simple operational Muteswan server written in perl using HTTP::Daemon is
available. It is very simple and implements the three required functionalities:
GET msg, POST msg and GET msg index.

This daemon is probably not appropriate for large volumes but given the
simplicity of Muteswan it should be usable to test and develop.


Android client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An client for Google's Android OS is functional at this point. This is the most
useful client situation. Since Muteswan is an instant messaging service
accessing the service on one's phone is ideal.

The Android client leaves much to be desired in the realm of user interface,
code quality and error reporting, but it does work at this early stage. It can
currently perform all the envisioned operations:

	- Share circles as QR codes
	- Import circles and identities from QR codes
	- Create a new circle
	- Post message to a circle
	- Read messages from circles
	- A persistent Android service is available to check and download new messages
	  at intervals.

The Android client depends on two other Android applications: Barcode Scanner
and Orbot. Orbot is the official Tor port for Android. Barcode Scanner is used
to offload QR code generation and scanning.
