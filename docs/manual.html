<h1>Aftff</h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>
Aftff is an experimental pseudo anonymous instant message system. It is pseudo
anonymous in the sense that the protocol maintains strict anonymity but message
access is dependent upon face to face human trust relationships.  The intention
is to provide a simple messaging service that is <ol><li> reasonably protected from
surveillance with encryption, </li><li> protects sender identity and </li><li>
protects receiver identity.</li></ol> Aftff adopts the notion of a "ring": a
collection of individuals that share a single symmetric key. Users share their
keys with other individuals face to face, in person using QR codes (2
dimensional bar codes). An aftff client in possession of a symmetric key can
send and receive messages to other people who possess the same key. The
identity of both sender and receiver are completely protected.

It is also possible, and in some cases desirable, to prove authorship of a
message to a subset of users on a ring. To achieve this, aftff uses RSA
public/private key pairs to establish identity. Identities can also be
exchanged using QR codes, like rings.
</p>

<p>
The idea is that this framework is flexible enough to be used on the one hand
as a private, secure communication platform and on the other hand as an
information dissemination tool. For example, two individuals sharing a key with
no other people in possession of the key enables private and trusted
communication. In other cases, such as in whistle blowing situations, identity
protection is paramount but access to the ring may be very widespread.  Between
these two extremes, it is hoped, are a wide variety of use cases.
</p>

<p>
Aftff uses Tor, specifically tor hidden services, to anonymize messages. A
hidden service on the Tor network is accessible only to other Tor clients and
the server does not know the identity of who is making the request nor does the
client know the identity of the hidden service serving the response. A very
simple RESTful protocol is used to post, read and list messages. Messages are
encrypted using AES and sent to the server. Messages are addressable on the
server by issuing a GET on the SHA1 hash of the AES key. 
</p>


<h2> Intentions, Assumptions and Goals </h2>

<p>
This document is intended to be a technical and design reference. The
background assumptions, project goals and potential uses of aftff are outside
the scope of this document. However, it is difficult to continue without some
overall frame to help contextualize the impetus and goals of the project.
</p>

<p>
Aftff rests on a few operating assumptions and requirements:
<ol>
	<li>Trust and identity are not always so closely related. There is more
need today to be able to trust information without knowing the identity/origin
of the information explicitly. Aftff should facilitate this where it is possible.</li>

	<li>Identity must always be protected. Both senders and receivers must
have plausible deniability.</li>

	<li>Simple and secure: protocol must be designed such that success of
any operation requires maximum anonymity. It should be impossible to use aftff
in such a way that leaks your identity. The server should be as small and
stateless as possible, without any logging features.</li>
	<li>The user should always have control of her identity and risk.</li>
</ol>

The goal of the aftff project is to create an experimental communication tool
that is literally "embedded" in the social and geographic space of its users.
The dissemination of information and trust networks, though anonymous, may
perhaps map more closely to real world social relations and thus provide some
level of trust. This (perhaps limited) level of trust is augmented with the
protection of message senders/receivers. Together these two properties (limited
but existent trust and very little individual risk) are desirable, especially
in contexts where communication is associated with legal or political risk.
</p>

<p>
In terms of hard and fast use cases, not very much has been developed. Below is a list of ideas that have been brought up. If you have more, please contact me.
<ul>
  <li>Protests, demonstrations and civil disobedience.<br> aftff should be useful in organization demonstrations and protests. For example, an ad-hoc protest at a military recruitment center could be organized using an aftff ring.</li>
  <li>Small group communication.<br> aftff could be used for something as simple as a book club or community garden. QR codes can be easily posted and communication is quick and easy, requiring no online registration, websites or the like.</li>
   <li>Whistle blowing or information dissemenation.<br> Rings that are extensively shared could be used to disseminate sensitive information.</li>
   <li>Private communication.<br> A ring with a distribution of two people provides a secure and private communication system.</li>
   <li>Geocaching.<br>Leaving a QR code for a ring or public key at a geocache site might be interesting.</li>
   <li>Workers organization at a workplace.<br> A system that protect anonymity yet allows dialog/discussion is ideal when workers organize against an employer or for a union. For example, leaders among the workers may be identified and communicate using identities while many more people, not comfortable with public support of the workers efforts, would be able to participate.</li>
   <li>Communication among illegal immigrants.<br> <li>aftff would enable illegal immigrants to both communicate securely and privately as well as organize in larger rings.</li>
</ul>


</p>


<h2> Protocol Overview </h2>

Aftff is extremely simple.  "Rings", or collective use of shared symmetric AES
keys plus a server name, provide centralized access to message data. Possessing
an appropriate AES key along with the name of the Tor hidden server enables
access to the messages on a given ring.

A client/server protocol was built on top of HTTP using RESTful principles.
Clients can:
<ol>
	<li>get a single message, </li>
	<li>receive a directory listing, </li>
	<li>or post a message.</li>
</ol>

The aftff server itself merely acts as a distribution point. It sends clients
messages and saves messages that are posted to rings but it does not process
or analyze any messages.

<img src="aftff.jpg"/>


<h3> 1. Rings </h3>

<p>
Rings are the only organizational unit in aftff. They are composed of three
elements:
<ol>
	<li>key: a 24-bit AES key,e.g, dba4fe6ef22b494d</li>
	<li>server: a tor hidden service address, e.g., tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion</li>
	<li>shortname: name of the ring, without spaces, e.g., testsite</li>
</ol>

Rings are usually represented in text form with a '+' separating the name from the key and an '@' separating the key from the server:<br>
<code>
testsite+dba4fe6ef22b494d@tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion
</code>
</p>

<p>
Since aftff uses symmetric keys, accessing a ring simply involves knowing the
key and the server. Consequently, the text representation of a ring should
never be displayed and the key should be treated as any cryptographic secret is
treated.  Aftff rings are intended to be shared in person, typically via
QR code. The rings should be trivial to communicate via QR code but there should
be absolutely no reason to transfer them digitally, ever. It should be
mentioned that perhaps one would desire to distribute QR codes openly if the
intention was to attract a large amount of users to a ring.
</p>

<h3> 2. Identities </h3>

Identities are RSA public/private key pairs. A user can generate a
public/private key pair, provide it with a name, and share the public key with
any number of people, just as they would a ring. The user can then optionally
sign any outgoing message thus proving their identity to whoever has the
appropriate public key. Like rings, public keys are communicate face to face
using QR codes.

Identities allow individuals to prove authorship at the risk of potentially
reducing anonymity. However, how a public is distributed is up to the
individual. If they share it with a few trusted people who do not redistribute
the key, someone may be able to post messages that to most people are
anonymous.

A public key can also be anonymously distributed and used to prove authorship,
whether or not the person who generated the key is known.

<h3> 3. Technical components </h3>

<p>
The individual technical components described below. In some cases, more detail
will be provided in later sections, but this section outlines the core
operative components.
</p>

<h4> 3.1 Tor client </h4>
<p>
Tor acts as a SOCKS proxy on the client node. Tor runs on many platforms,
including mobile ones. All aftff clients need a running local Tor proxy in
order to function.
</p>

<h4> 3.2 Tor hidden server </h4>
<p>
A Tor hidden service is made available on the Tor network using an RSA key. It
is accessible from a special address, e.g, tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion. This is
ideal because it protects anonymity in both directions. The server has no idea
who is talking to it; the client has no idea who they are talking to. Another
valuable property of the Tor hidden services is that since it does not resolve
to a globally routable IP there is no way to accidentally compromise any
identity protection.
</p>

<p>
Configuring a Tor hidden service is outside the scope of this document.
However, it is a relatively straightforward process. Once the hidden service is
configured in the Tor configuration file and the RSA key is available you are
ready to start Tor and then the aftff server itself. The aftff server knows
nothing about Tor: it simply sees HTTP requests originating from localhost. 
</p>


<h4> 3.3 aftff client</h4>
<p>
The aftff client queries the Tor hidden service address to fetch message
indexes, individual messages and to post messages. It provides the only
interface to the user. 
</p>

<p>
It is also the only place where aftff keys are stored.  The client is
responsible for managing its own cryptographic stores. At a minimum, this
requires storing key and server information.
</p>


<h4> 3.4 aftff server </h4>
<p>
The aftff server is a simple HTTP server using RESTful principles. The server
is essentially stateless: only POST and GET methods are implemented with the
index fetch being the only operation that is not strictly uploading or
downloading an actual file.
</p>

<p>
Since the server role is so narrow, it can implemented very minimally and
reduce security risks. Also, it should be noted that a compromise of an aftff
server could reveal other rings hosted on the hidden service but would not
expose any identities.
</p>

<h3> 4. QR codes </h3>
<p>
QR codes are used to transmit ring information to other users. Qrcodes were
chosen because they provide a very flexible, convenient and most importantly
they are "embedded in the physical world."
</p>

<p>
To transmit a ring to another user, a QR code needs to be generated using the
full text description of a ring (shortname+key@server). The individual
receiving the key scans the QR code and imports the ring information into their
client.
</p>

<h3> 5. Cryptography </h3>
<p>
Aftff uses standard AES CBC symmetric key cryptography. Every message is
encrypted with the ring key before it is sent. It is posted to the server based
on a SHA1 hash of the ring key. The AES cryptography provides protection from
anyone who has access to the actual tor hidden service as well as a certain
level of protection if an aftff server is compromised.
</p>

<p>
AES is currently used because it is secure and widely supported. The actual
cryptographic algorithm is not material and perhaps changing out or selecting
algorithms is a desirable feature.
</p>

<p>
Currently, the cryptography should be considered a serious deterrent as opposed
to iron clad protection. In current implemention, the same initialization
vector values are used for all keys. This could make key recovery easier for an
attacker that somehow gains control of the tor hidden server.
</p>


<h3> 6. HTTP/REST </h3>
<p>
Aftff uses a simple RESTful scheme on top of HTTP. Only GET and POST methods are
used and their URLs are well defined.  </p>

<p>
There are a few operational contraints of the server that help keep things simple and secure.
<ol>
 <li>The server should never alter the contents of a message.</li>
 <li>The server may verify message length and return a 413 Request Entity Too Large error if the message content is more than 10MB. FIXME: what should this be?</li>
 <li>All information the server provides the client must be in HTTP headers.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
JSON is used to encode the message formats. All messages must have a key name
of "message" which contains the base64 encoded encrypted data. For example:<br>
<code>
{"message":"X6h9V7Ynlz974yj5o+nE+Q=="}
</code>
</p>

<h4> 6.1 Headers </h4>
<p>
There are 2 headers currently used.
</p>

<p>
<b>Last-Message</b> An integer value that represents that last message on a ring. This is returned when a client issues a GET on a ring SHA1 hash.</p>

<p>
<b>Last-Modified</b> Standard HTTP field that indicates when a message was posted.
</p>



</p>

<h4> 6.2 POST msg </h4>
<p>
To post a message to a ring, an aftff client uses the POST method with the SHA1
hash of the ring in the request URI. No other argument is allowed on the URI.
</p>

<p>
An example POST request:
<pre>
POST /3db7814a7d0e23f66906fbfd087bbd8f523f7180 HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 32
Host: tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion
Connection: Keep-Alive

{"message":"X6h9V7Ynlz974yj5o+nE+Q=="}
</pre>
</p>


<p>
If the container (usually a file system directory) does not exist (that is, no
messages exist yet), than the container is created and the first message is
given an id of 1.
 </p>

<p>
All POST requests, if accepted, increment the new message index by one and
create a file of the same name in the SHA1 hash directory.
</p>



<p>
A message may optionally be signed. If a message is signed, the client must put a JSON array with the key 'signatures' into the payload. Each signature is composed of two colon separated fields. The first field is a SHA1 hash of the RSA public key used to sign the message. The second is the base64 encoded X509 encoded RSA signature. An example signed POST message (newlines introduced for readability):
<pre>
POST /f573fe7d4a34186b00bcab2b38e52122afe04d83
Content-Length: 1465
Host: tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion
Connection: Keep-Alive

</pre>
</p>

<h4> 6.3 GET msg </h4>
<p>
Fetching a message is as simple as requesting the message id in the URI. For example, the request to fetch message 53 from the 'testsite' ring would be:
<pre>
GET /f573fe7d4a34186b00bcab2b38e52122afe04d83/53 HTTP/1.1
Host: tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion
Connection: Keep-Alive

{"message":"X6h9V7Ynlz974yj5o+nE+Q=="}
</pre>
</p>

<h4> 6.4 GET msg index</h4>
<p>
A list of all available messages can be accessed by issuing a GET request on the SHA1 hash alone:
<pre>
GET /f573fe7d4a34186b00bcab2b38e52122afe04d83 HTTP/1.1
Host: tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion
Connection: Keep-Alive
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The message index is sent to the client in the HTTP response header,
"Last-Message". The Last-Message header indicates the most recent message id.
Since all messages are sequential, it implies that message 1 through
Last-Message are available.
</p>

<p>
All messages in a ring are assigned a simple index integer.
</p>

<h2> Implementations </h2>
<p>
There already exist a few implemented components. They are mostly reference
implementations to proof-of-concept the project. Please keep in mind that all of the implementations below assumes a Tor SOCKS proxy server is running on localhost at port 9050.
</p>
<h3> 1. Perl aftff server </h3>
<p>
A simple operational aftff server written in perl using HTTP::Daemon is
available. It is very simple and implements the three required functionalities:
GET msg, POST msg and GET msg index.
</p>

<p>
This daemon is probably not appropriate for large volumes but given the
simplicity of aftff it should be usable to test and develop.
</p>

<p>
Protoserver is available at:
<a href="http://unionoftheother.org/aftff/trunk/protoserver">http://unionoftheother.org/aftff/trunk/protoserver</a>
</p>



<h3> 2. Perl prototype cmdline tool </h3>
<p>
An aftff client is also available for the unix cmdline. It is 100% perl and
works on OS X as well as other Unixes. It is not particularly user friendly but
it can send/receive messages, generate keys, produce QR codes and manages its
own data store.
</p>

<p>
To use the cmdline tool, initialize a storefile:<br>
<code>./protoclient -d storefile init</code>
with a private password. After this you can run individual commands, such as to
create a ring.
</p>

<p>
Protoclient is available at:
<a href="http://unionoftheother.org/aftff/trunk/protoclient">http://unionoftheother.org/aftff/trunk/protoclient</a>
</p>


<h3> 3. Web interface to cmdline tool </h3>
<p>
A demonstration client was also built as a wrapper around the cmdline tool.
This should probably be destroyed but provides a demo of an aftff client
implemented as a local web server.
</p>

<p>
As long as the cmdline tool works, the web interface is runable by doing:<br>
<code>./protoclientd -d storefile -p storefilepassword</code>
Then access the server by going to <code>localhost:9051</code>
</p>

<p>
Protoclientd is available at:
<a href="http://unionoftheother.org/aftff/trunk/protoclientd">http://unionoftheother.org/aftff/trunk/protoclientd</a>
</p>


<h3> 4. Android client </h3>
<p>
An client for Google's Android OS is functional at this point. This is the most
useful client situation. Since aftff is an instant messaging service accessing
the service on one's phone is ideal.
</p>

<p>
The Android leaves much to be desired in the realm of user interface, code quality and error reporting, but it does work at this early stage. It can currently perform all the envisioned operations:
<ul>
	<li>Share rings and identities as QR codes</li>
	<li>Import rings and identities from QR codes</li>
	<li>Create a new ring</li>
	<li>Generate personal identity (RSA public/private key pair)</li>
	<li>Post message with or without signatures to rings</li>
	<li>Read messages from rings</li>
	<li>A persistent service is available to check and download new messages at interval.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The Android client depends on two other Android applications: Barcode Scanner and Orbot. Orbot is the official Tor port for Android. Barcode Scanner is used to offload QR code generation and scanning. You can download Barcode Scanner from the Market. You can get the latest Orbot here:
<a href="http://www.torproject.org/docs/android.html.en">http://www.torproject.org/docs/android.html.en</a>
</p>

<p>
If you download Barcode Scanner (which is needed) you can use it to quickly scan the QR code below for aftff and above for Orbot to easily install them. Just start Barcode Scanner and point it at the QR code.
</p>

<p>
The latest Android client is available at:
<a href="http://unionoftheother.org/android/aftff.apk">http://unionoftheother.org/android/aftff.apk</a>
</p>

<p>
You can also point a barcode scanner to this QRCode to download the apk easier.<br>
