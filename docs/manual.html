<h1>Aftff</h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>
Aftff is an experimental pseudo anonymous instant message system. It is pseudo
anonymous in the sense that the protocol maintains strict anonymity but message
access is dependent upon face to face human trust relationships.  The intention
is to provide a simple messaging service that is <ol><li> reasonably protected from
surveillance with encryption, </li><li> protects sender identity and </li><li> protects
receiver identity.</li></ol> Aftff adopts the notion of a "ring": a collection of
individuals that share a single symmetric key. Users share their keys with
other individuals face to face, in person. An aftff client in possession of a
symmetric key can send and receive messages to other people who possess the
same key. The identity of both sender and receiver are completely protected.
</p>

<p>
The hope is that this framework is flexible enough to be used on the one hand
as a private, secure communication platform and on the other hand as an
information dissemination tool. For example, two individuals sharing a key with
no other people in possession of the key enables private and trusted
communication. Another case, such as in whistle blowing situations, the
identity protection of both the sender and receivers are crucial while knowing
who, in particular, received the information is not.
</p>

<p>
Aftff uses Tor, specifically tor hidden services, to anonymize messages. A
hidden service on the Tor network is accessible only to other Tor clients and
the server does not know the identity of who is making the request nor does the
client know the identity of the hidden service serving the response. A very
simple RESTful protocol is used to post, read and list messages. Messages are
encrypted using AES and sent to the server. Messages are addressable on the
server by issuing a GET on the SHA1 hash of the AES key. This ensures that a
receiver of a message has the AES key prior to accessing encrypted data.
</p>


<h2> Intentions, Assumptions and Goals </h2>

<p>
This document is intended to be a technical reference. The background
assumptions, project goals and potential uses of aftff are outside the scope of
this document. However, it is difficult to continue without some overall frame
to help contextualize the impetus and goals of the project.
</p>

<p>
Aftff rests on a few operating assumptions and requirements:
<ol>
	<li>Trust and identity are not always so closely related. There is more
need today to be able to trust information without knowing the identity/origin
of the information explicitly. Aftff should facilitate this where it is possible.</li>

	<li>Identity must always be protected. Both senders and receivers must
have plausible deniability. Users must have complete control over their
identities.</li>

	<li>Simple and secure: protocol must be designed such that success of
any operation requires maximum anonymity. It should be impossible to use aftff
in such a way that leaks your identity. The server should be as small and
stateless as possible, without any logging features.</li> 
	<li>The user should always have control of her/her identity and risk.</li>
</ol>

The goal of the aftff project is to create an experimental communication tool
that is literally "embedded" in the social and geographic space of its users.
That is, the dissemination of information and trust networks, though anonymous,
may perhaps map more closely to actual real world social relations and thus
provide a level of trust.

</p>


<h2> Protocol Overview </h2>

Aftff is extremely simple.  "Rings", or collective use of shared symmetric AES
keys plus a server name, provide centralized access to message data. Possessing
an appropriate AES key along with the name of the Tor hidden server enables
access to the messages on a given ring.

A client/server protocol was built on top of HTTP using RESTful principles.
Clients can:
<ol>
	<li>get a single message, </li>
	<li>receive a directory listing, </li>
	<li>or post a message.</li>
</ol>

The aftff server itself merely acts as a distribution point. It sends clients
messages and saves messages that are posted to rings but it does not process
or analyze any messages.

<h3> 1. Rings </h3>

<p>
Rings are the only organizational unit in aftff. They are composed of three
elements:
<ol>
	<li>key: a 24-bit AES key,e.g, dba4fe6ef22b494d</li>
	<li>server: a tor hidden service address, e.g., tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion</li>
	<li>shortname: name of the ring, without spaces, e.g., testsite</li>
</ol>

Rings are usually represented in text form with a '+' separating the name from the key and an '@' separating the key from the server:<br>
<code>
testsite+dba4fe6ef22b494d@tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion
</code>
</p>

<p>
Since aftff uses symmetric keys, accessing a ring simply involves knowing the
key and the server. Consequently, the text representation of a ring should
never be displayed and the key should be treated as any cryptographic secret is
treated.  Aftff rings are intended to be shared in person, typically via
qrcode. The rings should be trivial to communicate via qrcode but there should
be absolutely no reason to transfer them digitally, ever. It should be
mentioned that perhaps one would desire to distribute qrcodes openly if the
intention was to attract a large amount of users to a ring.
</p>

<h3> 2. Technical components </h3>

<p>
Now that rings have been briefly introduced, the individual technical
components can be discussed. In some cases, more detail will be provided in
later sections, but this section outlines the core operative components.
</p>

<h4> 2.2 Tor hidden server </h4>
<p>
A Tor hidden service is made available on the Tor network using an RSA key. It
is accessible from a special address, e.g, tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion. This is
ideal because it protects anonymity in both directions. The server has no idea
who is talking to it; the client has no idea who they are talking to. Another
valuable property of the Tor hidden services is that since it does not resolve
to a globally routable IP there is no way to accidentally compromise any
identity protection.
</p>

<p>
Configuring a Tor hidden service is outside the scope of this document.
However, it is a relatively straightforward process. Once the hidden service is
configured in the Tor configuration file and the RSA key is available you are
ready to start Tor and then the aftff server itself. The aftff server knows
nothing about Tor: it simply sees HTTP requests originating from localhost. 
</p>


<h4> 2.3 aftff client</h4>
<p>
The aftff client queries the Tor hidden service address to fetch message
indexes, individual messages and to post messages. It provides the only
interface to the user. 
</p>

<p>
It is also the only place where aftff keys are stored.  The client is
responsible for managing its own cryptographic stores. At a minimum, this
requires storing key and server information.
</p>


<h4> 2.4 aftff server </h4>
<p>
The aftff server is a simple HTTP server using RESTful principles. The server
is essentially stateless: only POST and GET methods are implemented with the
index fetch being the only operation that is not strictly uploading or
downloading an actual file.
</p>

<p>
Since the server role is so narrow, it can implemented very minimally and
reduce security risks. Also, it should be noted that a compromise of an aftff
server could reveal other rings hosted on the hidden service but would not
expose any identities.
</p>

<h5> 2.5 qrcodes </h5>
<p>
qrcodes are used to transmit ring information to other users. Qrcodes were
chosen because they provide a very flexible, convenient and most importantly
they are "embedded in the physical world."
</p>

<p>
To transmit a ring to another user, a qrcode needs to be generated using the
full text description of a ring (shortname+key@server). The individual
receiving the key scans the qrcode and imports the ring information into their
client.
</p>

<h3> 4. Cryptography </h3>
<p>
Aftff uses standard AES CBC symmetric key cryptography. Every message is
encrypted with the ring key before it is sent. It is posted to the server based
on a SHA1 hash of the ring key. The AES cryptography provides protection from
anyone who has access to the actual tor hidden service as well as a certain
level of protection if an aftff server is compromised.
</p>

<p>
AES is currently used because it is secure and widely supported. The actual
cryptographic algorithm is not material and perhaps changing out or selecting
algorithms is a desirable feature.
</p>

<p>
Currently, the cryptography should be considered a serious deterrent as opposed
to iron clad protection. In current implemention, the same initialization
vector values are used for all keys. This could make key recovery easier for an
attacker that somehow gains control of the tor hidden server.
</p>


<h3> 5. HTTP/REST </h3>
<p>
Aftff uses a simple RESTful scheme on top of HTTP. Only GET and POST methods are
used and their URLs are well defined.  </p>


<p>
JSON is used to encode the message formats. All messages must have a key name
of "message" which contains the base64 encoded encrypted data. For example:<br>
<code>
{"message":"X6h9V7Ynlz974yj5o+nE+Q=="}
</code>


</p>

<h4> 5.1 POST msg </h4>
<p>
To post a message to a ring, an aftff client uses the POST method with the SHA1
hash of the ring in the request URI. No other argument is allowed on the URI.
</p>

<p>
An example POST request:
<pre>
POST /3db7814a7d0e23f66906fbfd087bbd8f523f7180 HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 32
Host: tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion
Connection: Keep-Alive

{"message":"X6h9V7Ynlz974yj5o+nE+Q=="}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
If the container (usually a file system directory) does not exist (that is, no
messages exist yet), than the container is created and the first message is
given an id of 1.
 </p>

<p>
All POST requests, if accepted, increment the new message index by one and
create a file of the same name in the SHA1 hash directory.
</p>

<h4> 5.2 GET msg </h4>
<p>
Fetching a message is as simple as requesting the message id in the URI. For example, the request to fetch message 53 from the 'testsite' ring would be:
<pre>
GET /f573fe7d4a34186b00bcab2b38e52122afe04d83/53 HTTP/1.1
Host: tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion
Connection: Keep-Alive

{"message":"X6h9V7Ynlz974yj5o+nE+Q=="}
</pre>
</p>

<h4> 5.3 GET msg index</h4>
<p>
A list of all available messages can be accessed by issuing a GET request on the SHA1 hash alone:
<pre>
GET /f573fe7d4a34186b00bcab2b38e52122afe04d83 HTTP/1.1
Host: tckwndlytrphlpyo.onion
Connection: Keep-Alive
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The message index is sent to the client in the HTTP response header,
"Last-Message". The Last-Message header indicates the most recent message id.
Since all messages are sequential, it implies that message 1 through
Last-Message are available.
</p>

<p>
All messages in a ring are assigned a simple index integer.
</p>

<h2> Implementations </h2>
<p>
There already exist a few implemented components. They are mostly reference
implementations to proof-of-concept the project. Please keep in mind that all of the implementations below assumes a Tor SOCKS proxy server is running on localhost at port 9050.
</p>
<h3> 1. Perl aftff server </h3>
<p>
A simple operational aftff server written in perl using HTTP::Daemon is
available. It is very simple and implements the three required functionalities:
GET msg, POST msg and GET msg index.
</p>

<p>
This daemon is probably not appropriate for large volumes but given the
simplicity of aftff it should be usable to test and develop.
</p>

<p>
Protoserver is available at:
<a href="http://unionoftheother.org/aftff/trunk/protoserver">http://unionoftheother.org/aftff/trunk/protoserver</a>
</p>



<h3> 2. Perl prototype cmdline tool </h3>
<p>
An aftff client is also available for the unix cmdline. It is 100% perl and
works on OS X as well as other Unixes. It is not particularly user friendly but
it can send/receive messages, generate keys, produce qrcodes and manages its
own data store.
</p>

<p>
To use the cmdline tool, initialize a storefile:<br>
<code>./protoclient -d storefile init</code>
with a private password. After this you can run individual commands, such as to
create a ring.
</p>

<p>
Protoclient is available at:
<a href="http://unionoftheother.org/aftff/trunk/protoclient">http://unionoftheother.org/aftff/trunk/protoclient</a>
</p>


<h3> 3. Web interface to cmdline tool </h3>
<p>
A demonstration client was also built as a wrapper around the cmdline tool.
This should probably be destroyed but provides a demo of an aftff client
implemented as a local web server.
</p>

<p>
As long as the cmdline tool works, the web interface is runable by doing:<br>
<code>./protoclientd -d storefile -p storefilepassword</code>
Then access the server by going to <code>localhost:9051</code>
</p>

<p>
Protoclientd is available at:
<a href="http://unionoftheother.org/aftff/trunk/protoclientd">http://unionoftheother.org/aftff/trunk/protoclientd</a>
</p>


<h3> 4. Android client </h3>
<p>
An client for Google's Android OS is functional at this point. This is the most
useful client situation. Since aftff is an instant messaging service accessing
the service on one's phone is ideal.
</p>

<p>
The Android client can currently scan qrcodes, send/receive messages, browse
message indexes, store saved keys and post messages to rings. However, the UI
leaves much to be desired.
</p>

<p>
The latest Android client is available at:
<a href="http://unionoftheother.org/android/aftff.apk">http://unionoftheother.org/android/aftff.apk</a>
</p>

<p>
You can also point a barcode scanner to this QRCode to download the apk easier.<br>
