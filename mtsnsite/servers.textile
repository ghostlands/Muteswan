h1(entry-title). Muteswan Servers

Muteswan servers run behind Tor hidden nodes. There is a sample server
available but folks are encouraged to stand up their own servers for themselves
or their community.

The sample server is built into the Android Muteswan client but please
understand this should only be used to experiment with Muteswan.

h3(entry-title). Running your own server

Running your own Muteswan server is relatively straightforward. It involves three main steps:

# Compile or download the server for your platform
# Configure a Tor hidden node
# Run the server using a file or MongoDB backed datastore
